  Hello, my name is Eduardo Vazquez, I am an emerging student at a program called YearUp where I study Software Development. I currently work at Amazon, as a warehouse associate. My goal is to graduate from the YearUp program and become a software developer within a tech company.  I would love to keep in contact with you and learn more about your career and any advice you have for me, can we connect on LinkedIn and set up a coffee-chat?
